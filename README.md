# SoccerNet-Video-Captioning

# 

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a **Video Captioning** system, which generates textual descriptions for videos by integrating **computer vision** and **natural language processing (NLP)** techniques. The system extracts spatiotemporal visual features and generates meaningful captions using a transformer-based language model.

## Features
- Processes video data and generates captions in natural language.
- Uses **VideoMAE** for video feature extraction.
- Fine-tuned **GPT-2** for caption generation.
- Trained on the **Soccernet Video Captioning Dataset**.

## System Workflow
1. **Input:** A video clip is provided to the system.
2. **Feature Extraction:** VideoMAE extracts key spatiotemporal representations.
3. **Text Generation:** GPT-2 processes extracted features to generate a relevant caption.
4. **Output:** A textual description summarizing the video content.

## Model Selection
- **VideoMAE** was chosen for its state-of-the-art video feature extraction capabilities.
- **GPT-2** was fine-tuned to generate fluent and contextually relevant captions.

## Dataset
- The system was trained and evaluated on the **Soccernet Video Captioning Dataset**, which consists of soccer-related video clips with annotated captions.

## Implementation Details
- Fine-tuned **VideoMAE** for video feature extraction.
- Fine-tuned **GPT-2** for sequence generation.
- Optimized **fusion strategies** for aligning visual and textual representations.
